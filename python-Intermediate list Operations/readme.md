## 1. Squares of Numbers 🧮
**Description:**
Generate a list of squares for numbers ranging from 1 to 10 using list comprehension.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Square each number using the **2 operator.
3. Store the results in a new list.

**Key Points:**
- Efficient computation using list comprehension.
- Simplified one-liner syntax.

---

## 2. Filtering Even Numbers 🔢
**Description:**
Create a list of even numbers from 1 to 10 using conditional list comprehension.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Check divisibility by 2 (i % 2 == 0).
3. Include only even numbers in the list.

**Key Points:**
- Combines iteration and filtering.
- Concise and efficient for filtering tasks.

---

## 3. Tuples with Numbers and Squares 🎯
**Description:**
Generate a list of tuples where each tuple contains a number and its square.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Pair each number with its square as a tuple.
3. Store tuples in a list.

**Key Points:**
- Structured data pairing.
- Useful for paired relationships.

---

## 4. Flattening Nested Lists 🗂️
**Description:**
Flatten a nested list into a single-level list using list comprehension.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through sublists in the nested list.
2. Extract each element from sublists.
3. Combine elements into a flat list.

**Key Points:**
- Simplifies handling nested data.
- Prepares data for further processing.

---

## 5. Finding Vowels in a String 🔤
**Description:**
Extract vowels from a given string using list comprehension.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through each character in the string.
2. Check if the character is a vowel.
3. Collect vowels in a list.

**Key Points:**
- Isolates specific characters.
- Adaptable for filtering other patterns.

---

## 6. Merging Two Lists 🔗
**Description:**
Combine two separate lists into one using the + operator.

**Steps:**
1. Take two lists.
2. Merge them using the + operator.

**Key Points:**
- Preserves order.
- Returns a new list without modifying originals.

---

## 7. Converting to Upper Case 🔠
**Description:**
Convert all elements in a list to uppercase using list comprehension.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through each element.
2. Apply the .upper() method.
3. Collect uppercase values.

**Key Points:**
- Useful for text normalization.
- Ensures consistent casing.

---

## 8. Removing Specific Elements ❌
**Description:**
Remove all occurrences of a specific value from a list.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through each element.
2. Exclude elements matching the specified value.

**Key Points:**
- Filters unwanted data.
- Retains order of remaining elements.

---

## 9. Checking for an Empty List 🔍
**Description:**
Determine if a list is empty using a condition.

**Steps:**
1. Use the `not` keyword to check for emptiness.
2. Print a message indicating the result.

**Key Points:**
- Quick validation check.
- Useful in conditional logic.

---

## 10. Replacing Vowels in Text 🌟
**Description:**
Replace all vowels in a string with a specific character.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through each character.
2. Replace vowels with *.
3. Combine modified characters.

**Key Points:**
- Masks sensitive information.
- Retains structure.

---

## 11. Reversing Elements in a List 🔄
**Description:**
Reverse the order of elements using slicing.

**Steps:**
1. Use list slicing `[::-1]` to reverse.
2. Store the result in a new list.

**Key Points:**
- Simple syntax.
- Efficient for reversing sequences.

---

## 12. Finding Prime Numbers 🔵
**Description:**
Identify prime numbers within a range using list comprehension.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through numbers.
2. Use all() to check divisibility.
3. Filter prime numbers.

**Key Points:**
- Compact logic for prime checking.
- Suitable for mathematical operations.

---

## 13. Finding Common Elements 🤝
**Description:**
Find common elements between two lists using list comprehension.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through elements of one list.
2. Check membership in the second list.

**Key Points:**
- Simplifies intersection tasks.
- Useful for comparisons.

---

## 14. Calculating Factorials ✖️
**Description:**
Generate a list of factorials for numbers from 1 to 5.

**Steps:**
1. Use `math.factorial` in comprehension.
2. Compute and store results.

**Key Points:**
- Leverages built-in math functions.
- Simplifies computations.

---

## 15. Duplicating Elements 🔂
**Description:**
Duplicate elements in a list based on a given condition.

**Steps:**
